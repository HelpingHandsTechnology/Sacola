# Summary

We need to have the share articles feature on Sacola and we've some different approaches for that. You can see all the approaches bellow:

## Share with Everyone

#### Good points:

- Easier implementation
- The user doesn't need to wait anything to share/receive articles

#### Bad points:

- Users can receive articles from people that they don't want

#### Additional Comments

- Maybe we can add a block feature? so we can prevent this issue of users receiving articles from people that they don't want even using this 'Share with everyone' approach

## Share with Friends List

#### Good points:

- Users can control who they want to receive/share articles

#### Bad points:

- With that Approach, we'll need to think and work on a certain amount of new features, like for example:
  - Friendslist
  - Send friendship invites
  - Accept friendship invites
  - Remove a friend
- Users will need to wait for other users to accept their friendship invite to start to share/receive articles
